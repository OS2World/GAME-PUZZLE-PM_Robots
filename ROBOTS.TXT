Version:	1.4
----------------------------   


DESCRIPTION
-----------
This program is a version of the classic UN*X game "robots" for     
the OS/2 Presentation Manager.  The main idea is that you are chased
by robots, and the object to is make them crash into each other before 
they get you.

It's Smiley against the Evil Killer Robots.  Smiley is hopelessly 
outnumbered, but with your intellect, you might be able to save him.
Fortunately, for you and Smiley, the robots have the stupid habit of
crashing into each other in their pursuit.

Everytime you make a move, the robots move a space closer to Smiley.

The tools that you have available to you are a Sonic Screwdriver and
a Teleporter Device.  The Sonic Screwdriver obliterates all the robots
adjacent to Smiley, but can only be used once per level.  The Teleporter 
Device can be used to get Smiley out of a tight spot, but each time you
use it, you run the risk of teleporting next to a robot (which spells
certain doom for Smiley).

Clicking the left mouse button moves Smiley in the direction of the 
mouse pointer (a question mark means that Smiley can't move in that
direction).  Available moves are shown by the green diamonds around
Smiley.  Clicking directly over Smiley takes a turn without making
a move (letting the robots catch up).  The menu bar provides access to 
the Teleporter and the Sonic Screwdriver.  The "Wait" button (or the 
right mouse button) takes turns until there is a robot breathing down
Smiley's neck.

Points are awarded as follows : 10 points for every robot that crashes
into another robot or into a robot heap, and 1 point for every robot 
obliterated with the Sonic Screwdriver.  Bonuses are awarded for not
using the Sonic Screwdriver on a particular level (50 points) and for
successful teleports (1 point per visible robot).

Special thanks to Brian Warkentine for his inspirational XROBOTS.
There are many versions of robots around, and all the authors deserve
credit.  This version was written entirely from scratch, July 1993.

COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS
--------------------
This version was modified to compile on ArcaOS with GCC 9 compiler. It also uses the Watcom Linker and Watcom Resource Compiler. 

The requeriments for compile this version are:
- yum install git gcc make libc-devel binutils watcom-wrc watcom-wlink-hll

1) Remember to have correct header files your path. For GCC the correct ones are the included on the "libc-devel", not the ones from the OS/2 Toolkit. Check your config.sys for "SET INCLUDE=C:\usr\include"

2) Since I'm using the Watcom Resource Compiler and Watcom Linker (open source) instead of the classic rc.exe and ilink.exe, add to your config.sys...
 SET EMXOMFLD_RC_TYPE=WRC
 SET EMXOMFLD_RC=wrc.exe
 SET EMXOMFLD_LINKER=wl.exe
 SET EMXOMFLD_TYPE=WLINK

3) Run "make" to compile or "make 2>&1 |tee make.out" to compile and get the log file. A compile.cmd file was provided to run the compile process.
