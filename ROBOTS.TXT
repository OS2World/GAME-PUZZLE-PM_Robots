            Presentation Manager Robots v1.3
     Copyright (c) 1993,1994,2002 by Kent Lundberg

This program is a version of the classic UN*X game "robots" for     
the OS/2 Presentation Manager.  The main idea is that you are chased
by robots, and the object to is make them crash into each other before 
they get you.

It's Smiley against the Evil Killer Robots.  Smiley is hopelessly 
outnumbered, but with your intellect, you might be able to save him.
Fortunately, for you and Smiley, the robots have the stupid habit of
crashing into each other in their pursuit.

Everytime you make a move, the robots move a space closer to Smiley.

The tools that you have available to you are a Sonic Screwdriver and
a Teleporter Device.  The Sonic Screwdriver obliterates all the robots
adjacent to Smiley, but can only be used once per level.  The Teleporter 
Device can be used to get Smiley out of a tight spot, but each time you
use it, you run the risk of teleporting next to a robot (which spells
certain doom for Smiley).

Clicking the left mouse button moves Smiley in the direction of the 
mouse pointer (a question mark means that Smiley can't move in that
direction).  Available moves are shown by the green diamonds around
Smiley.  Clicking directly over Smiley takes a turn without making
a move (letting the robots catch up).  The menu bar provides access to 
the Teleporter and the Sonic Screwdriver.  The "Wait" button (or the 
right mouse button) takes turns until there is a robot breathing down
Smiley's neck.

Points are awarded as follows : 10 points for every robot that crashes
into another robot or into a robot heap, and 1 point for every robot 
obliterated with the Sonic Screwdriver.  Bonuses are awarded for not
using the Sonic Screwdriver on a particular level (50 points) and for
successful teleports (1 point per visible robot).

There are many versions of robots around, and all the authors deserve
credit.  This version was written entirely from scratch, July 1993.
